We may or may not conduct an initial review of Service Provider profiles, but, except where explicitly specified in the Indoorphins Service (and then only to the extent specified), we do not otherwise screen Service Providers or Participants. You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Service Provider, providing Fitness Services, or otherwise interacting with users via the Indoorphins Service.

Arbitration Agreement</span><span class="c5">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH Indoorphins AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.1 Arbitration Agreement; Claims</span><span class="c7">. This Section 17 is referred to as the &quot;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo; in these Terms. Unless you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in accordance with the procedure described in Section 17.9 below, you and Indoorphins (together, the &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;) agree that any and all disputes or claims that arise between you and Indoorphins relating to the Indoorphins Service, interactions with others on the Indoorphins Service, and/or these Terms (including any alleged breach of these Terms) (collectively, &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">Claims</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;), except for Excluded Claims (defined in the following sentence), will be resolved as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. As used herein, &ldquo;Excluded Claims&rdquo; means (1) individual claims brought in small claims court (if your claims qualify), (2) claims arising out of or related to a violation of Section 4.1, above, (3) claims in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property (including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents), and (4) claims that, as a matter of applicable law, cannot be made subject to arbitration.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.2 Agreement to Arbitrate</span><span class="c7">. You agree that any and all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be resolved exclusively </span><span class="c5">on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, rather than in a court,</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and </span><span class="c5">your rights in connection with all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not by a judge or jury</span><span class="c2">. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent that the Parties&#39; dispute involves both timely filed Excluded Claims and other Claims subject to this Agreement, the Parties agree to bifurcate and stay for the duration of the arbitration proceedings any such Excluded Claims.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.3 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</span><span class="c7">. </span><span class="c5">YOU AND Indoorphins AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE WAIVED AS A MATTER OF LAW) AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Indoorphins AGREE OTHERWISE (OR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE WAIVED AS A MATTER OF LAW), THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S OR PARTY&#39;S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c12">ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&#39;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER Indoorphins SERVICES USERS.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.4 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</span><span class="c7">. Before you commence arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint. Our preference will always be to resolve complaints amicably and efficiently, without the need for arbitration. You may contact us via email at </span><span class="c17">hello</span><span class="c17">@indoorphins.fit. </span><span class="c2">If the issue is not resolved and results in arbitration, we will need to mutually select and agree upon an arbitrator and the rules and procedures to govern the arbitration.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.5 Arbitration Procedures</span><span class="c7">. The Parties will try in good faith to mutually select and agree upon an arbitrator and rules and procedures to govern the arbitration. If we cannot agree, then the arbitration will be conducted in English by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with your choice of the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the &ldquo;JAMS Rules&rdquo;), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The rules that apply are those in effect when arbitration is demanded by either of the Parties. The JAMS Rules are available at </span><span class="c15"><a class="c18" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1595812217247000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fg8wGvIZ0zDBf7mTCMWDj">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and are incorporated in these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the Rules or waive your opportunity to read the Rules and any claim that the Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. If there is any inconsistency between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 16. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. The arbitrator shall submit a decision in writing, specifying the findings of fact and the conclusions of law on which the decision is based. Decisions by the arbitrator are binding and enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">The arbitration will be held in King County, Washington. </span><span class="c7">If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 USD (or equivalent in local currency) or less, Indoorphins may elect </span><span class="c2">to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Indoorphins, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Indoorphins users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Indoorphins user to the extent required by applicable law. As limited by applicable law, these Terms and the applicable JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have (1) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Claim, including the determination of whether a Claim is arbitrable, and (2) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.6 Costs of Arbitration</span><span class="c7">. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the &quot;</span><span class="c5">Arbitration Fees</span><span class="c2">&quot;) will be shared equally by you and Indoorphins, except where prohibited by applicable law. Each party will be solely responsible for all fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Indoorphins for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Indoorphins on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the JAMS.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.7 Confidentiality</span><span class="c2">. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.8 Severability</span><span class="c2">. If any term, clause or provision of this Section 16 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 16 will remain valid and enforceable.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16.9 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</span><span class="c2">. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Indoorphins prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we terminate this Arbitration Agreement by removing it from these Terms, such termination will not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and will not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Indoorphins prior to the effective date of removal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5 c12">17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">T</span><span class="c7">hese Terms, and any dispute between you and Indoorphins, will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 17 (the Arbitration Agreement). Unless you and we agree otherwise, or except where prohibited by applicable law, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that arises between you and Indoorphins must be resolved exclusively by, and that you are submitting to the jurisdiction, of the courts in the State of Washington. You and Indoorphins a</span><span class="c7">gree that the venue of any such lawsuit will be held in King County, Washingto</span><span class="c2">n.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">18. Miscellaneous</span><span class="c7">. Nothing in these Terms will be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, worker, or employee of the other. Neither party will have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that will be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. These Terms are non-exclusive and do not prohibit Service Providers from offering Fitness services via other means or third parties. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms will in no way</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;affect</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms will be enforceable as so modified. To the maximum extent possible under applicable local law, this Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.</span></p><p class="c20 c14"><span class="c12 c24"></span></p><p class="c14 c20"><span class="c24 c12"></span></p></body></html>
